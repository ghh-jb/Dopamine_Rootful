# Dopamine

=== ATTENTION! ===
Before using this repository - go and star original Dopamine because without it this project wouldnt be possible.

This repo was forked from the commit: [2cfd690ac07d35eef62f42396a9989441a47b768](https://github.com/opa334/Dopamine/commit/2cfd690ac07d35eef62f42396a9989441a47b768) so it includes spinlock fix. No bootlogos at the moment though.

A rootful semi-untethered jailbreak for iOS 15.x (arm64e) and iOS 15.0 - 15.8.6 (arm64). More details will follow here soon.

Please note that all issues related to version support will be deleted without response.
